# Plan for Converting React+Vite Portfolio to Flask App

## Step 1: Setup Flask Environment ✓
- Create requirements.txt with Flask and other dependencies ✓
- Create a .gitignore file for Python-specific files ✓

## Step 2: Create Flask Application Structure ✓
- Create app.py as the main Flask application file ✓
- Remove any manually created static/templates folders (not needed) ✓

## Step 3: Build the React Application
- Run `npm run build` to generate the production build
- This will automatically:
  - Compile all TSX files to JavaScript
  - Bundle all CSS, JS, and assets
  - Output everything to the 'dist' folder

## Step 4: Configure Flask to Serve the React Build ✓
- Update the Flask app to serve static files from the 'dist' directory ✓
- Add a catch-all route to handle React client-side routing ✓

## Step 5: Test the Application
- Run the Flask application locally
- Test all pages and functionality

## Step 6: Deployment Considerations
- Add a Procfile for deployment platforms like Heroku
- Configure any environment variables needed
